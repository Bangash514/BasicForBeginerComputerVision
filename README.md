# 🧠 Computer Vision Practice Projects

This repository contains my hands-on practice in **Image Processing**, **Computer Vision**, and **Deep Learning** using Python. I'm learning and applying various techniques including filters, transformations, morphological operations, and image classification using CNNs.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 📦 Basic Image Processing

- `DisplayImage.py`: Simple script to load and display an image using OpenCV or PIL.
- `BasicTransformations.py`: Image rotation, scaling, translation, and flipping.
- `Filters_GaussianBlurandEdgeDetection.py`: Gaussian blur and Canny edge detection.
- `Filters_Sobel Edge Detection.py`: Edge detection using Sobel filter.
- `Histogram Analysis.py`: Plotting and analyzing image histograms.
- `Histogram Equalization.py`: Improving contrast using histogram equalization.
- `Int_01- Morphological operations.py`: Dilation, erosion, opening, and closing.
- `Int_Facial_Features_Labeled/`: Facial feature labeling project (under development).

### 🧠 Deep Learning Projects

- `Image-Classification-01.py`: Feature extraction from a single image using pretrained ResNet18.
- `Image-Classification 02/`: Loading skin lesion image(s), extracting features, and preparing for classification with future fine-tuning.
- `cat-vs-dog-classifier/`: Simple binary image classifier using CNN (WIP).
- `YOLOv5-Object-Detection/`: Object detection using pretrained YOLOv5 model.
